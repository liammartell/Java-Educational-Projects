Telling someone to just relax is not the best choice for this type of mental health crisis. Anxiety is not easily controlled by everybody, and some people have a really hard time trying to lower their anxiety levels. You want to show support to your friends if they are going through something like this. Provide them with resources, such as SAMHSA’s mental health help line (1-800-662-HELP (4357)) or even the school’s counselor.
