Erica did what you told her to do yesterday and tried to go to bed earlier than usual. When you see her the next morning, you notice that she is even more tired than before. She comes over to talk to you and tells you that she did not get any sleep last night. She starts to remember that she has a huge test in her second period class and couldnâ€™t focus enough to study. She starts to panic (breathing more quickly and starts to sweat.) What do you do in this situation?
