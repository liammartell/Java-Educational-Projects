You provide her with resources to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (AADA) to help find a counselor, or to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) helpline - 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Another suggestion that you could give her is to talk to the school counselor. They should be able to help or provide other resources to receive more help.
