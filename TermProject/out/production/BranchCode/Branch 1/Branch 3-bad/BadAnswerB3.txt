As Ericaâ€™s friend, you would want to help her in this situation. The teacher would understand why you were late to class if you explained to them that your friend was experiencing a panic attack. Leaving Erica alone like that could have made the situation a lot worse. If you see your friend experiencing something like that, make sure to try to handle the situation, and let a nearby adult know what is happening.

Erica just experienced a panic attack and needed the support from a mental health first aider. These situations can be scary, but at least letting a teacher or adult know about the situation is what one should do to help in an event like this. After the situation, reach out to Erica and make sure she is ok. Ask her what you can do to help in case this happens again. Provide her with resources for the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration helpline - 1-800-662-HELP (4357).
