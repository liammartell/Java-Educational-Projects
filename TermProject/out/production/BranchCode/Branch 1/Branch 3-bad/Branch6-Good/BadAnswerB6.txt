Anxiety is not easily controlled by everybody. Everybody deals with anxiety differently, but something is really wrong if someone has a panic attack. As her friend, you need to provide support as she’s going through this issue. Provide her with resources to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (AADA) or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration helpline - 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Or suggest that she speak with the school’s counselor. They would be able to provide help or other resources for Erica to seek out.
