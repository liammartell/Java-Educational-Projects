MP2 is a redeveloped version of the dice rolling game written in C++. Two players take turns rolling dice and trying to collect 100 points.
The points are the sum of the dice roll, and 1's deter your score. Much of the change between the C++ and Java versions of this game comes
with the GUI. The code is written to update labels with each roll and notify whose turn it is using colors. There is also very low level 
animation for the actual dice rolls that uses a timer and an array of images.
